# SNHU-CS-465

Throughout this course, there were a few different technologies that were used to develope the front end and the back end of this web application. This web application was developed in Express HTML and eventually converted to one that used Angular for the single page web application for this project. HTML is static and client facing only. This means that it cannot interact with backend databases and requires a request to the server or data source to update its information. Using newer technologies such as Express of Angular allow for these newer technologies in the cases where this would be necessary for that specific project. Using these newer technologies would also allow for the web application to utilize the advanaced functionality of the Javascript programming language. 

<!-- During the the full stack project development, there were a few different types of front end code that were used in different parts of the application. The customer facing site was developed originally in Express HTML and then converted over to a .hbs view to help with rendering speeds by not having to fully load every component of the site at each refresh. HTML is static and client facing, which means it can;t interact with backend databases to dynamically update information. Javascript is a frontend and backend coding language that is used to add dynamic elements to the webpage. This was used to pull trip information from the MongoDB database so that the page can change dynamically based on user interaction. A single-page application is a website that doesn't fully refresh the page based on user interactions like an HTML page would. This is particularlly useful in giving the website a local/native application feel when interacting with the applicaiton itself. -->
